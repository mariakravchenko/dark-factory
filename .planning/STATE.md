# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-06)

**Core value:** A delivery run is durable — its complete lifecycle state lives in Neon, so any process on any machine can resume exactly where a previous one stopped and still produce a correct, independently verified GitHub PR.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Walking Skeleton: One Durable Run

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 12 (Walking Skeleton — One Durable Run)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-07 — Roadmap created (12 phases, 89/89 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Tracer-first (PROJECT_MODE = mvp) — Phase 1 is a walking skeleton (minimal Neon persistence + enum FSM with resume-first `advance(run_id)` + FakeWorker + one role + `run`/`status`), every later phase adds a vertical slice.
- [Roadmap]: Checkpoint-in-Postgres, not replay — control state read from `runs` columns; `run_events` is append-only audit only.
- [Roadmap]: Postgres-only concurrency — conditional-UPDATE lease + guarded status update; no distributed-lock service.
- [Roadmap]: Real worker adapters split across two phases — Claude Code first (Phase 7) to prove the vertical slice, then Copilot + Hermes (Phase 8) to prove worker independence.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Three research-flagged decisions, each scheduled inside the phase that first needs it:

- Artifact-content durability for cross-machine resume → resolve in Phase 5 (leading option: commit artifacts to the run's working branch). Schema implications noted in Phase 1.
- Lease TTL vs. unpredictable agent step duration → resolve in Phase 2 (heartbeat every TTL/3; slow-step + competing-process test).
- Exact non-interactive flag/env matrix for the Copilot and Hermes CLIs → hands-on spike in Phase 8; can be spiked earlier to de-risk.
